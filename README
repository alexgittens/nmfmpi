An implementation of the Benson et al. one-pass NMF algorithm that uses the near-separability assumption to equate NMF on a matrix to column-selection on the R in its QR factor. Since the matrix is assumed tall-and-skinny, we use TSQR to get the R fast, then use the XRay algorithm to do the column-selection on R. This implementation was written by Aditya Devarakonda (mirrored here because he doesn't have it up on github) for our report comparing Spark performance for matrix factorizations to that of traditional MPI-based solutions.
